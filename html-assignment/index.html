        <h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
        <p>Hey there! My name is Charles, and I'm a 27 year old <strong>Interactive Media Design</strong> student at <strong>Algonquin College</strong>. I also work part time as a bartender at <em>Gitanes</em> located on <em>Elgin Street</em>, in downtown <strong>Ottawa</strong>. I have a <em>beautiful and amazing</em> partner named <em>Vanessa</em>, with whom I share a wonderful little dog named <em>Zeus</em>.</p>
        <p>I am incredibly excited to be a part of the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> Program at <abbr title="Algonquin College">AC</abbr>. For the last few years I have worked in the restaurant industry, but after the onset of the <strong>COVID-19</strong> pandemic, I decided it was time for a change. I have always been interested in <em>Design</em>, and recently discorvered an interest in <em>Coding</em> as well!</p>
